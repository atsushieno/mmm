This is an attempt to implement M processor, probably to just generate
a parser and C#-or-assembly proxy generator.

It depends on Irony (included Irony.dll), which can be fully downloaded from:
http://www.codeplex.com/irony

MGrammar.txt is almost extracted from Oslo M community specification:

MGrammarGenerator.exe is a hacky tool that generates C# source that
derives from Irony.Compiler.Grammar (so it will become the actual
M grammar implementation) from MGrammar.txt. It is to ease upgrading
possibly revised specification draft.
